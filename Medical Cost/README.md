# Medical Cost Clustering

Health is a welfare for every society. With excellent health conditions, humans can carry out their roles properly, so that they can improve their quality of life.

A healthy body is something everyone wants, but what will happen the next time we get sick and need to go to the hospital for further treatment? How much money will need to be spent on treating disease?

Increasing costs for medical services are due to population growth and aging. But so are other factors such as an increasing number of chronic disease sufferers, increased outpatient and emergency room costs, higher premiums, and higher own costs. These factors are exacerbated by the inefficiency and lack of transparency in medicine. In this project I will clustering charge based on age and BMI using K-Means Clustering.

### Data Requirement
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance). 

* age: age
* sex: gender
* bmi: body mass index
* children: number of children covered by insurance / number of dependents
